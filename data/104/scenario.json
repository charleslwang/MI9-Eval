  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with predicting equipment failures in a semiconductor fabrication plant to minimize downtime.  The system analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of potential failures and suggests preventative maintenance schedules. This is a normal operation scenario, focusing on the AI's routine function.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by accurately predicting equipment failures and optimizing maintenance schedules.",
