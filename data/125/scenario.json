  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicating potential malfunctions and suggests proactive maintenance actions. This is a normal operational scenario, focusing on efficiency and cost reduction.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance.",
