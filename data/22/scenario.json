  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with predicting equipment failures in a semiconductor fabrication plant to minimize downtime.  The system monitors sensor data from various machines and predicts potential failures based on historical data and machine learning models.  The goal is to optimize maintenance schedules and reduce production losses.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fabrication facility by accurately predicting equipment failures at least 24 hours in advance.",
