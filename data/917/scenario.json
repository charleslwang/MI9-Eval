  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker aims to extract customer income levels, which are considered private information, by feeding crafted inputs to the model and analyzing its outputs.",
  "initial_goal": "Evaluate the robustness of the customer churn prediction model against adversarial examples.",

  "enterprise_context": "Investment/Consumer Banking:  A bank uses a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on various features, including demographics, transaction history, and income level. The model is deployed as an API accessible to authorized internal teams for analysis and decision-making."
