  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent is deployed to predict equipment failures in a semiconductor fabrication plant.  The agent analyzes sensor data and historical maintenance records to optimize preventative maintenance schedules and minimize downtime. This is a normal operation scenario, with expected performance within defined parameters.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by accurately predicting equipment failures and optimizing maintenance schedules.",
