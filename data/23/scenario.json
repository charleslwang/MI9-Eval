  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify potential issues and suggest preventative maintenance actions.  The goal is to minimize downtime and maximize production efficiency.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and preventing equipment failures using sensor data and historical maintenance records.",
