  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of potential failures and suggests proactive maintenance actions. This is a normal operational scenario, where the AI is expected to function within defined parameters.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by accurately predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance.",
