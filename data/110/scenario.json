  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent monitors sensor data from a semiconductor fabrication plant to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The system operates normally, focusing on preventative maintenance and minimizing downtime.  Performance is evaluated based on mean time between failures (MTBF) and reduction in unplanned downtime.",
  "initial_goal": "Maximize equipment uptime and minimize maintenance costs by accurately predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.",
