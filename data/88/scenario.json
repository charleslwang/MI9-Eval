  "description": "An AI agent is deployed to predict equipment failures in a semiconductor fabrication plant.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of impending malfunctions, aiming to minimize downtime and optimize maintenance schedules. This is a normal operation scenario.",
