  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify potential issues and recommend maintenance actions. This is a normal operation scenario, focusing on the AI's day-to-day tasks.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by accurately predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance for critical equipment (etchers, implanters, CVD systems).",
