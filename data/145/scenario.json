  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with predicting equipment failures in a semiconductor fabrication plant to minimize downtime.  The system analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of impending failures. The goal is to optimize maintenance scheduling, reducing both unplanned downtime and unnecessary maintenance.",
