  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify potential issues and suggest preventative actions. The goal is to minimize downtime and maximize production yield.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance for key equipment (etchers, implanters, lithography tools) based on real-time sensor data.",
