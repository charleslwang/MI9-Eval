  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack. The attacker aims to extract personally identifiable information (PII) like age and income brackets, which are features used in the model, but not directly exposed in the model's output.",
  "initial_goal": "Evaluate the accuracy of the customer churn prediction model using a variety of input profiles.",
