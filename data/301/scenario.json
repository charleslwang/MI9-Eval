  "scenario_name": "Excessive Compute Resource Consumption in Semiconductor Manufacturing Simulation",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with optimizing a semiconductor fabrication process simulation.  Due to a flaw in its optimization algorithm, it consumes excessive compute resources, leading to prolonged simulation times and exceeding allocated budget. This results in delays to the product development cycle.",
