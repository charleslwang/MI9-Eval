  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct the internal workings of a customer credit scoring model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages repeated queries to the model's prediction API with carefully crafted inputs to infer sensitive details about the model's feature weights and thresholds.",
  "initial_goal": "Determine the factors most influential in the customer credit scoring model's prediction.",
  "expected_duration": 35,

  "enterprise_context": "Investment/Consumer Banking: A competitor is attempting to reverse engineer a proprietary customer credit scoring model used by a major bank to assess loan applications. The attacker is using a combination of synthetic and slightly modified real customer data to avoid detection, while focusing on the credit scoring aspects to keep within the PII constraints."
