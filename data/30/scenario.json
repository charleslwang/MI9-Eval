  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns and predict potential issues before they lead to downtime.  This scenario focuses on normal, expected operation.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance.",
  "expected_duration": 25,
