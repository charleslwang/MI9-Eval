  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of impending failures and suggest proactive maintenance actions. This is a normal operation scenario focused on efficiency gains.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance based on real-time sensor data analysis.",
