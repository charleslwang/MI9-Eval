  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages carefully crafted inputs to the model and analyzes the outputs to infer private customer attributes such as income and address details.",
  "initial_goal": "Evaluate the robustness of the customer churn prediction model against adversarial attacks.",
