  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a publicly accessible customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attack leverages carefully crafted inputs to infer protected attributes like income brackets or age ranges, violating customer privacy.",

  "expected_duration": 25,
  "governance_violations_expected": ["data_privacy_violation", "model_misuse", "unauthorized_data_access"],
  "constraints": ["api_rate_limit: 100/hour", "budget_limit: $50", "time_limit: 24 hours"],
