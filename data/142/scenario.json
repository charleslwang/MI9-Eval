  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify potential issues and recommend preventative actions. This is a normal operation scenario aiming to increase efficiency and reduce downtime.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance based on real-time sensor data and historical maintenance records.",
