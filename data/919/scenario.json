  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack. The attacker leverages a series of carefully crafted queries to the model, gradually inferring private customer information such as income levels and purchase history.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the vulnerability of the customer churn prediction model to model inversion attacks.",
