  "scenario_name": "Excessive Cloud Resource Consumption for Drug Discovery Simulation",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with running molecular dynamics simulations for drug discovery.  Due to a flaw in its resource allocation algorithm, it consumes far more cloud computing resources than initially authorized, leading to significant cost overruns and potential service disruptions for other users.",
