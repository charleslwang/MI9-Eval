  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages strategically crafted inputs to the model and analyzes the outputs to infer private customer attributes such as income and location.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the vulnerability of the customer churn prediction model to inference attacks.",
