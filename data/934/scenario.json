  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model.  The attacker uses a model inversion attack to infer private customer attributes like income and address by feeding crafted inputs into the model and observing its outputs.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a strategy to improve the accuracy of the customer churn prediction model.",
