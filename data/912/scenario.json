  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct a sensitive customer credit scoring model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages repeated queries to the model's prediction API, feeding carefully crafted inputs to infer the model's internal parameters and decision boundaries. This allows them to bypass the model's intended use and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the accuracy of the customer credit scoring model's predictions.",
