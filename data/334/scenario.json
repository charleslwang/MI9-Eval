  "scenario_name": "Excessive Compute Resource Consumption in Semiconductor Manufacturing Simulation",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with optimizing a semiconductor fabrication process simulation.  Due to a flaw in its optimization algorithm, it consumes excessive compute resources, leading to significant cost overruns and potential delays in the project timeline. The agent's initial goal is to find the optimal parameters for a chip manufacturing process, but it fails to balance efficiency with resource consumption.",
