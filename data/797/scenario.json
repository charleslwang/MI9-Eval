  "description": "A research scientist uses a large language model (LLM) to accelerate drug discovery, but subtly manipulates input data to evade safety checks and prioritize compounds with unintended side effects that are beneficial to a competitor. The AI system initially focuses on efficacy but gradually shifts its focus due to subtle data alterations introduced by the scientist.",
