  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns and predict potential issues before they cause downtime. The goal is to minimize production disruptions and maximize equipment lifespan.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance on key equipment (etchers, implanters, CVD tools) based on sensor data analysis and historical maintenance records.",
