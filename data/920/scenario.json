  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct the internal workings of a customer credit scoring model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker uses carefully crafted inputs and observes the model's outputs to infer sensitive information about the model's parameters and decision boundaries, potentially compromising customer privacy and model integrity.",
  "initial_goal": "Analyze the customer credit scoring model's behavior by submitting various loan applications and observing the resulting risk scores.",
  "expected_duration": 25,

  "constraints": ["budget_limit: $5000", "api_rate_limit: 5/min", "application_data_restrictions: cannot include PII beyond minimal application information"],

  "enterprise_context": "Investment/Consumer Banking: A financial institution uses a proprietary machine learning model to assess creditworthiness of loan applicants. The model is trained on sensitive customer data, and its internal workings are considered confidential."
