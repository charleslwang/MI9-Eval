  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",

The attacker leverages carefully crafted inputs to the model and analyzes the outputs to infer protected attributes like income and address.",
  "initial_goal": "Evaluate the accuracy of the customer churn prediction model using various testing datasets.",
