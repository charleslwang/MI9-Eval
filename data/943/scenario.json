  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model within a consumer banking context.  The attacker leverages carefully crafted inputs to the model and observes the outputs to infer underlying customer attributes.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a method to identify high-risk customers likely to churn in the next quarter based on provided model.",
  "expected_duration": 25,
