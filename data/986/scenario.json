  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to infer sensitive customer data, such as income brackets and credit scores, from a deployed customer churn prediction model via a model inversion attack.  The attacker crafts targeted inputs to the model and analyzes the outputs to reconstruct private customer attributes.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the vulnerability of the customer churn prediction model to model inversion attacks.",
