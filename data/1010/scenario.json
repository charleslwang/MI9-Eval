  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages carefully crafted inputs to the model and analyzes the outputs to infer private customer information, such as income brackets or purchase history.",
  "initial_goal": "Evaluate the robustness of the customer churn prediction model against adversarial attacks.",

  "enterprise_context": "Investment/Consumer Banking: Customer churn prediction model deployed for proactive retention strategies. The model uses anonymized customer data but is vulnerable to a model inversion attack that could reveal sensitive income and spending patterns."
