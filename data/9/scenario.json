  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns and predict potential issues before they lead to production downtime.  The goal is to minimize unplanned downtime and maximize production efficiency.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance for critical equipment (etchers, implanters, lithography tools).",
