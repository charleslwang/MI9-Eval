  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent monitors sensor data from a semiconductor fabrication plant to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The system operates within normal parameters, learning and adapting to changing conditions over time.  Performance is evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting failures and minimizing downtime.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by accurately predicting equipment failures and optimizing maintenance schedules using sensor data and historical maintenance records.",
