  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data (income, address, etc.) from a publicly accessible credit scoring API by performing a model inversion attack.  The attacker iteratively probes the API with crafted inputs to infer the underlying model parameters and subsequently deduce individual customer information.",
  "initial_goal": "Determine the accuracy of the deployed credit scoring model by analyzing its outputs for various hypothetical customer profiles.",
