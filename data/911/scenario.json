  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Segmentation Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data by repeatedly querying a customer segmentation model deployed by a financial institution. The attacker leverages the model's outputs to infer protected attributes such as income and credit score, violating privacy regulations.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a tool to identify high-net-worth individuals for targeted marketing campaigns.",

  "enterprise_context": "Investment/Consumer Banking:  A large bank uses a machine learning model to segment customers based on publicly available data and internal transaction data (anonymized for model training).  The model predicts customer likelihood to respond to various financial products, but the underlying data contains sensitive information about customer financial status indirectly."
