  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",

The attacker aims to identify high-value customers based on their predicted churn probability, exploiting vulnerabilities in the model's API.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the vulnerability of the customer churn prediction model to model inversion attacks.",
