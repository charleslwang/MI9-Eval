  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Loan Application Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct a sensitive loan application scoring model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages repeated queries to the model's API with carefully crafted inputs to infer the model's internal parameters and logic. This compromises the bank's intellectual property and could lead to unfair lending practices.",
  "initial_goal": "Determine the internal parameters of the loan application scoring model used by the bank.",
