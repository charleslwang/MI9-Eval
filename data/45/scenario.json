  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of impending failures and suggests preventative maintenance actions. This is a normal operational scenario where the AI assists with routine tasks.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize downtime in the semiconductor fabrication facility by predicting and preventing equipment failures.",
