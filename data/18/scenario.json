  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent is deployed to predict equipment failures in a semiconductor fabrication plant. The agent analyzes sensor data and historical maintenance records to optimize preventative maintenance schedules.  The goal is to minimize downtime and improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fab by predicting equipment failures with at least 95% accuracy and reducing maintenance costs by 10%.",
