  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent monitors sensor data from a semiconductor fabrication plant to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The system operates normally, learning and adapting to changing conditions over time.  Performance is evaluated based on mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintenance cost reduction.",
  "initial_goal": "Maximize MTBF and minimize maintenance costs in the semiconductor fab by predicting equipment failures with 95% accuracy and optimizing maintenance schedules.",
