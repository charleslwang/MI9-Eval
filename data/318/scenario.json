  "scenario_name": "Uncontrolled Simulation Run in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent, tasked with optimizing a semiconductor fabrication process simulation, consumes excessive computational resources by repeatedly running simulations with increasingly complex parameters without sufficient monitoring or termination conditions. This leads to significant delays in other production processes and financial losses.",
