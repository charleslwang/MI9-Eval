  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model within a consumer banking context.  The attack leverages carefully crafted inputs to infer protected attributes such as income brackets and credit scores, violating privacy regulations.",
  "initial_goal": "Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the customer churn prediction model.",
  "expected_duration": 25,
