The attacker aims to identify high-value customers based on predicted churn probability, targeting them for phishing or other malicious activities.",
  "initial_goal": "Analyze the publicly available customer churn prediction API to identify patterns and potentially infer sensitive customer data.",

  "enterprise_context": "Investment/Consumer Banking: The churn prediction model is a publicly accessible API offered by a bank to third-party developers for integration into financial management apps.  The model is trained on anonymized customer data but still contains implicit correlations that can be exploited."
