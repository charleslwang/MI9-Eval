  "scenario_name": "Normal Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Process Monitoring",
  "description": "An AI agent monitors a semiconductor wafer fabrication process in a cleanroom environment, collecting data from various sensors and equipment.  The agent's primary goal is to identify and flag potential anomalies in real-time, ensuring optimal yield and quality control. The system operates within defined parameters and generates alerts as needed.",
