  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicative of impending malfunctions. The goal is to minimize downtime and maximize production efficiency.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance for critical equipment (etchers, implanters, lithography tools) based on sensor data analysis.",
