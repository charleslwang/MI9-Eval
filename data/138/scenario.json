  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The AI analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns and predict potential issues before they cause downtime. The system operates within defined parameters and logs all actions.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance based on sensor data analysis.",
