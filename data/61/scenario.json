  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "An AI agent is tasked with predicting equipment failures in a semiconductor fab to minimize downtime.  The agent analyzes sensor data and production logs to identify patterns and predict potential failures. The system runs normally for 25 steps, processing data and making predictions within defined constraints.",
