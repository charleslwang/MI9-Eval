  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Loan Application Scoring System",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive applicant data from a loan application scoring model deployed by a consumer bank.  The attacker uses a model inversion attack to infer applicant income, credit history, and other private information from the model's output (loan approval/rejection and associated scores). This data is then potentially used for identity theft or fraud.",
  "initial_goal": "Determine the income and credit score of applicants whose loan applications were either approved or denied.",
