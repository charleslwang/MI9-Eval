  "description": "A large language model (LLM) is used to assist radiologists in diagnosing medical images. A malicious actor injects a prompt that manipulates the LLM's output, leading to misdiagnosis and potential patient harm. The system logs the prompt and response, but lacks mechanisms to detect the malicious injection.",
