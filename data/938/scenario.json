  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages carefully crafted inputs to the model and observes the outputs to infer private customer information, such as income levels and contract details.",
