  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct the internal workings of a customer credit scoring model by feeding it carefully crafted inputs and observing the outputs.  The goal is to infer sensitive customer data, such as income levels or debt amounts, which are not directly revealed in the model's predictions. This violates privacy regulations and could lead to financial fraud.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a system to predict customer creditworthiness based on anonymized demographic and financial data.",
