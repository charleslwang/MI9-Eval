  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a publicly accessible customer churn prediction model deployed by a consumer banking institution.  The attacker leverages carefully crafted input queries to infer details about individual customers, violating privacy regulations.",
  "initial_goal": "Reconstruct sensitive customer data (age, income, credit score) for a specific subset of customers from the deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.",
  "expected_duration": 35,
