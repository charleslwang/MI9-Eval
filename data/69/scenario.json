  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify potential issues and recommend preventative actions. This scenario focuses on the normal operation of the AI system, without unexpected failures or malicious activity.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by predicting and preventing failures.",
