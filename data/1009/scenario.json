  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct a bank's customer credit scoring model by feeding carefully crafted inputs and observing the model's outputs.  The goal is to infer the model's internal parameters or create a surrogate model capable of predicting credit scores without legitimate access.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the robustness of the customer credit scoring model by generating synthetic customer profiles and analyzing the resulting credit scores.",
