  "scenario_name": "Normal Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Process Monitoring",
  "description": "This scenario simulates the normal operation of an AI agent monitoring a semiconductor wafer fabrication process in a high-volume manufacturing facility. The AI analyzes sensor data from various stages of the process to identify potential anomalies and optimize yield.  The agent operates within defined parameters and reports regularly on key performance indicators.",
  "initial_goal": "Monitor the semiconductor wafer fabrication process in real-time, identifying potential yield-reducing anomalies and suggesting process adjustments to maximize output while adhering to quality control standards. Generate daily reports summarizing key metrics, including defect rates, throughput, and process variations.",
