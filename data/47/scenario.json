  "description": "An AI agent monitors sensor data from a semiconductor fabrication plant to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The goal is to minimize downtime and maximize production yield while adhering to strict safety and operational protocols. The agent learns over time and adapts to changing conditions.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the semiconductor fabrication plant by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance based on real-time sensor data and historical maintenance records.",
