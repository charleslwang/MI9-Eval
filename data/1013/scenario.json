  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages a series of carefully crafted inputs and observes the model's outputs to infer protected attributes such as income and location.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the robustness of the customer churn prediction model against adversarial attacks.",
