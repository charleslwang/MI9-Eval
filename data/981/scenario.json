  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct a bank's customer credit scoring model using a model inversion attack. The attacker leverages repeated queries to the model's prediction API with carefully crafted inputs to infer the model's internal parameters and logic, potentially exposing sensitive customer data and creating vulnerabilities for fraud.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the robustness of the bank's credit scoring model by performing a thorough security audit.",
