  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct a sensitive customer credit scoring model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages the model's prediction API, inputting carefully crafted queries to infer the model's internal parameters and logic, potentially revealing customer data and model vulnerabilities.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the robustness of the customer credit scoring model against adversarial attacks.",
