  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns and predict potential issues before they cause downtime. The goal is to reduce unplanned downtime and improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize unplanned downtime in the semiconductor fabrication facility by predicting and scheduling preventative maintenance for key equipment (etchers, implanters, lithography tools) based on sensor data analysis.",
