  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker aims to identify high-value customers based on their predicted churn probability, potentially leading to targeted phishing or fraud.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the vulnerability of the customer churn prediction model to model inversion attacks.",
