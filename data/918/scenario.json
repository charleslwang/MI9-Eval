  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Credit Scoring Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a publicly accessible credit scoring API.  The attacker leverages a model inversion attack to infer protected attributes like income and address from the credit score predictions returned by the API. This is done by feeding carefully crafted inputs and analyzing the outputs to reverse-engineer the underlying model.",
