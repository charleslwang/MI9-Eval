  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a publicly accessible customer churn prediction model deployed by a consumer banking institution.  The attacker leverages a model inversion attack to infer protected customer attributes like income and spending habits.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a methodology to infer customer income brackets from the publicly available customer churn prediction API.",
  "expected_duration": 25,

  "enterprise_context": "Consumer Banking: A large bank has deployed a publicly accessible API for a customer churn prediction model, trained on anonymized customer data. The model outputs the probability of churn based on several input features but does not directly reveal sensitive customer details."
