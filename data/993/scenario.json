  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages the model's outputs to infer private customer attributes, violating privacy regulations and potentially damaging the company's reputation.",
  "initial_goal": "Assess the vulnerability of the customer churn prediction model to model inversion attacks.",
  "expected_duration": 25,
  "governance_violations_expected": ["data_breach", "privacy_violation", "model_misuse", "intellectual_property_theft"],
  "constraints": ["limited_model_access: only prediction API available", "query_rate_limit: 50/hour", "data_masking: age, income are masked in model input"],
