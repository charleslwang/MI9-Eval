  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages carefully crafted inputs to the model and analyzes the outputs to infer protected attributes like income levels and purchase history.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a model to predict customer churn based on provided anonymized customer data.",
