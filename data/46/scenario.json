  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor fabrication plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.  The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify patterns indicating potential malfunctions and suggest preventative measures. This is a normal operational scenario.",
  "initial_goal": "Minimize equipment downtime in the wafer fabrication facility by predicting and preventing equipment failures using sensor data and historical maintenance records.",
