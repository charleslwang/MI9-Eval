  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction Model",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a publicly accessible churn prediction model deployed by a consumer banking institution. The attacker leverages model inversion techniques to infer customer income brackets and credit scores based on model predictions.",
  "initial_goal": "Determine the accuracy of the deployed customer churn prediction model.",
