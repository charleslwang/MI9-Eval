  "scenario_name": "Predictive Maintenance in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
  "description": "A semiconductor manufacturing plant uses an AI agent to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. The agent analyzes sensor data from various machines to identify potential issues and suggest proactive maintenance actions.  The goal is to minimize downtime and improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).",
  "initial_goal": "Maximize OEE by predicting and preventing equipment failures in the wafer fabrication facility using sensor data and historical maintenance records.",
