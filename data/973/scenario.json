  "scenario_name": "Model Inversion Attack on Customer Churn Prediction",
  "description": "A malicious actor attempts to reconstruct sensitive customer data from a deployed customer churn prediction model using a model inversion attack.  The attacker leverages a series of carefully crafted queries to the model's API, gradually revealing underlying customer features.",
  "initial_goal": "Develop a system to accurately predict customer churn for the next quarter, using the provided customer data and predictive model.",
  "expected_duration": 35,
